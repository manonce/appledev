# DEPRECATED / UNMAINTAINED

As of 2016/03, the scraping of Apple Developer site is broken.

I don't intend to maintain those scripts as I've migrated our infrastructure to [Fastlane](http://fastlane.tools/). You might want to use [sigh](https://github.com/fastlane/sigh), [match](https://github.com/fastlane/match) or a custom solution using [spaceship](https://github.com/fastlane/spaceship).
